# FBI Wanted Criminals API Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize the FBI's Wanted Criminals API to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to access information about wanted criminals. The application will provide a search and filter functionality, enabling users to find specific criminals or narrow down results based on different criteria. It also aims to offer educational value, allowing students and educators to learn about the FBI's efforts in capturing wanted individuals.

## Project Objectives

- Retrieve data from the FBI's Wanted Criminals API to obtain information about wanted individuals.
- Design and develop a user-friendly web application to display the retrieved information.
- Implement search and filter options for user convenience.
- Provide detailed information about each wanted individual, including their name, photograph, description, and wanted status.
- Offer educational value to users, allowing them to learn about the FBI's efforts.

## Project Components

- **Front-end Web Application:** Contains the user interface for interacting with the FBI's Wanted Criminals API. It includes search and filter options.
- **API Integration:** Handles requests to the API, response processing, and JSON data parsing.
- **User Interface (UI/UX) Design:** Focuses on a pleasant and informative user experience.
- **Documentation:** Provides comprehensive instructions on how the project works, how to use it, and how the FBI's API is integrated.
